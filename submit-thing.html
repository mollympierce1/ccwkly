<h1>Submit your thing!</h1>

<p>We aim to provide our subscribers with a highly edited, quick-view list of the things we're sure they don't want to miss. Because of this, we can't guarantee your event will fit the week's email. We will though, favor a variety of events that are well-presented, exciting and fresh, reliably awesome, or for a great cause. You don't need to be established or well-known - we're here to promote everyone who's livening up our favorite city.</p>

<p><a href="mailto:ccwkly@hrmg.agency">Email us</a> and be sure to include everything we need to know about your event and your organization and we'll do what we can do support the killer things happening in Corpus Christi, TX.</p>
